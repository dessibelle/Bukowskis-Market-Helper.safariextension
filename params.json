That way, when you are hovering a current bid it will be temporarily replaced by the total amount you'd have to pay for the item in question. When you are placing your bid, a total price will also appear next to the bid amount input field.\r\n\r\n### [Download Safari Extension](http://dessibelle.github.io/Bukowskis-Market-Helper.safariextension/download/Bukowskis-Market-Helper.safariextz)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
