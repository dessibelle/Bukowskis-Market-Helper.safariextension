# Bukowskis Market Helper

Bukowskis Market Helper is a Safari Extension that helps you with the bidding by automatically calculating the total price (i.e. including commission and hammer fee), when hovering certain prices or placing bids on [bukowskismarket.com](http://www.bukowskismarket.com). That way, when you are hovering a current bid it will be temporarily replaced by the total amount you'd have to pay for the item in question. When you are placing your bid, a total price will also appear next to the bid amount input field.
